# PyBer_Analysis
Python program to analyze Ride Share fare data in different types of cities

## Overview of Project
 The objective of this project is to sumarize the ride sharing data of the different city types and visualize the data. We will then make suggestions on the best business practices based on our findings.
### Purpose
    The purpose of this challenge was to use python to visiallize our summarized data and make suggestions based on our findings. It is meant to demonstrate knowledge for both pandas and MatplotLab in python.

 
## Results 
Based on the PyBer_fare_summary.png image in the analysis folder ("analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png") we can see the differences in each of the city types. Urban cities lead the way, collecting the most fares out of all city types week over week. They are followed by the Suburban market being the second highest performing market with the Rural market being the lowest performing. There is an apperent overwhelming disparity between fare collection amoung the data types.  
   
## Summary 
In order to close the disparities between the city types, I would create incentives for the lower performing markets to use ride sharing services. Since they are smaller markets, creating demand for ride share services are neccessary in order to increase the amount they are brining in week over week. By giving customers incentives, you generate demand and increase the number of rides people would take. You could also increasing the rates in the lower performing markets to increase the ammount of fares coming in week over week. This will allow the amount of fares to increase without increasing ride count. Finally,  You could also combine the two suggestions, by increasing the rates and offering a discount if they hit a certain number of rides. This will encourage more rides at a higher rate.
